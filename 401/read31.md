- The downside to virtual machines are their size and speed.

### Images and Containers

An image is a snpashot in time of what a project contains.
A container is a running instance of that image.
Image layering: Every image is made up of one or more images.
this exists for two reasons.

1. Each image is unchangeable
2. Second is performance
