# Class 41 Reading Notes

## REACT Review 4

### NextJS - Dynamic Routes

- we create an [id].js file to act as a new paage for each item created
- pull necessary data by using the getPostData method
- polish up the page with some HTML/ react components/ nextjs componenets

### Next - JS Deployment

Deploy to vercel

- push to github
- import repository
- Next.js works well with Vercel becasue its created by the same people
- while Vercel is preferred you can use any service that supports nodeJS

#### What I want to know more about

- Is vercel used by big companies?
