# Class 16 Reading Notes

## Serverless Computing

Serverless is a cloud computing application development and execution model that enables developers to build and run application code without provisioning or managing servers or backend infrastructure.

- there are most definitely servers in serverless computing.
'Serverless' describes the developer’s experience with those servers—they are are invisible to the developer, who doesn't see them, manage them, or interact with them in any way.

- FaaS, is a cloud computing service that enables developers to run code or containers in response to specific events or requests, without specifying or managing the infrastructure required to run to code.

 Serverless is an entire stack of services that can respond to specific events or requests, and scale to zero when no longer in use

- Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, management and scaling of containers. Kubernetes' automation dramatically simplifies the development of container-based applications.

 Serverless applications are often deployed in containers. But on its own, Kubernetes can't run serverless apps without specialized software that integrates Kubernetes with a specific cloud provider's serverless platform.

### Pros & Cons

 Given all of the preceding, it should be no surprise that serverless computing offers a number of technical and business benefits to individual developers and enterprise development teams.

Improved developer productivity: As noted above, serverless enables development teams to focus on writing code, not managing infrastructure. It gives developers much more time to innovate and optimize their front-end application functionality and business logic.

Pay for execution only: The meter starts when the request is made, and ends when execution finishes. Compare this to the infrastructure as a service (IaaS) compute model, where customers pay for the physical servers, virtual machines (VMs) and other resources required to run applications, from the time they provision those resources until the time they explicitly decommission them.

Develop in any language: Serverless is a polyglot environment, enabling developers to code in any language or framework—Java, Python, JavaScript, node.js—with which they're comfortable.

Streamlined development/DevOps cycles. Serverless simplifies deployment and, in a larger sense, simplifies DevOps because developers don't spend time defining infrastructure required to integrate, test, deliver and deploy code builds into production.

Cost-effective performance. For certain workloads—embarrassingly parallel processing, stream processing, certain data processing tasks—serverless computing can be both faster and more cost-effective than other forms of compute.

Usage visibility. Serverless platforms provide near-total visibility into system and user times and can aggregate usage information systematically.

Development and IT professionals cite other specific benefits of serverless computing.
