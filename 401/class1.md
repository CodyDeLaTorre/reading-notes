# Class 1 Reading Notes

## Pain

Pain is immportant to me because Lance Armstrong once said  “Pain is temporary. Quitting lasts forever.” In order to succeed you have to go through pain.

1. **What’s your perspective?** My perspective on pain is thay like the reading states I belive it is a by product of success and that it is highly likely to experience it on the journey to success.
2. **Why are you doing this?** I am doing this for multiple reasons.1: To secure a better paying job to provide for my family of four. 2: I enjoy coding. 3: I enjoy building things. 4: I want to contribute to a largescale software that helps other people.
3. **Do you want what comes at the end of this journey?** I do want what comes at the end of this journey. I want to secure a job in the tech industry and get proof of my knowledge through projects and a certification.
4. **Are you doing this for you?** Yes and no. Mostly doing it because of the crushing weight that is existence as the sole provider of your family, knowing that the success of your family depends on your success and that if you fail depends on if your family eats or not. I also enjoy coding and building things.

## Big O Notation

- O(1) describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set.
- O(N) describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set. The example below also demonstrates how Big O favours the worst-case performance scenario; a matching string could be found during any iteration of the for loop and the function would return early, but Big O notation will always assume the upper limit where the algorithm will perform the maximum number of iterations.

- O(N²) represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set. This is common with algorithms that involve nested iterations over the data set. Deeper nested iterations will result in O(N³), O(N⁴) etc.

- O(2^N) denotes an algorithm whose growth doubles with each addition to the input data set. The growth curve of an O(2^N) function is exponential — starting off very shallow, then rising meteorically. An example of an O(2^N) function is the recursive calculation of Fibonacci numbers
