# The Command Line

## The Command Line Itself

It is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text. Opening the terminal is diferent on each OS.

## Basic Navigation

To find out where you are you can use the **pwd** command. Now that you know where you are you can look around and see what is in there by typing **ls** or **ls -a** to get a list of files or folders in your location. To move to different locations use **cd**.

## More About Files

Technically in Linux, everything is a file, even directorys. You can use the **file** command to find out what type of file a file is.

## Manual Pages

The manual pages are a set of pages that explain every command available on your system including what they do, the specifics of how you run them and what command line arguments they accept. **man**

## File Manipulation

You can make a folder or directory with **mkdir**. You can remove a directory using the **rmdir** command and remove a file using **rm**. You can create a file using **touch**. You can also copy a directory using **cp**. You can move files using **mv**
