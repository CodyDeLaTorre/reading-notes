# Class 4 Reading Notes

## Python Classes

Objects are an encapsulation of variables and functions into a single entity. Objects get their variables and functions from classes. Classes are essentially a template to create your objects.
You can create multiple different objects that are of the same class(have the same variables and functions defined). However, each object contains independent copies of the variables defined in the class.
The __init__() function, is a special function that is called when the class is being initiated. It's used for assigning values in a class.

## Thinking Recursively in Python

A recursive function is a function defined in terms of itself via self-referential expressions.
This means that the function will continue to call itself and repeat its behavior until some condition is met to return a result.
