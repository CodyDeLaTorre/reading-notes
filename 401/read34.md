# Class 34 Reading Notes

## Django Setting Best Practices

The issues:

- All of the different environments we use
- The need to hide our sensitive keys in our project or api data
- The ability to share setting between team members
- The settings are in python code

Solutions:

- use a seperate file for all of the environment specific info called setting_local.py
- Store settings in Django env variables

## things I want to know more about

is there a one size fits all settings template?
