# Class 29 Reading Notes

## Danjgo Custom User

- It's highly recommended to use a custom user rather than Djangos built-in user for real world projects
- to get started create a custom user model and two new forms (usercreation and userchange)
- always create a superuser to act as an admin for testing purposes
- conect urls and views for the new user forms (login, registration)

## Django X

Django X is super useful template for creating django projects!!

## Things I Want To Know More About

- Why cant we use the base user model? Is the custom user just more flexible?
