# Reading 5 Notes

## CSS

Example: Basic Syntax: name {
    color: red;
}

There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:

- External CSS
- Internal CSS
- Inline CSS (highest priority)

## Issues

It is unusual for all browsers to implement a feature at the same time, and so there is usually a gap where you can use some part of CSS in some browsers and not in others.

## Ways to Color

- Hexadecimal color
- Hexadecimal colors with transparency
- RGB colors
- RGBA colors
- HSL colors
- HSLA colors
- Predefined/Cross-browser color names
With the currentcolor keyword
