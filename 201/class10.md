# Class 10 Reading Notes

## Troubleshooting JavaScript

1. Syntax errors are mispellings in JS code while logic errors are spelled correclty but giving unexpected results

2. I've gotten many a syntax errors, sometimes I just need to reformat the document or it's one single semicolon ruining my whole day. As for logical errors that usually takes me while as I feel like patrick in that episode of spongebob when his brain is smoking

3. This topic will continue to influence my long term goals by helping me become a better debugger when there are errors in my projects

## The JS Debugger

1. The JS debugger is a tool in your web browser that allows you to look over any errors in you JS files

2. breakpoints is where you want to pause execution of the JS debugger

3. The Call stack section shows you what code was executed to get to the current line. You can see that the code is in the function that handles a mouse click, and that the code is currently paused on the breakpoint.
