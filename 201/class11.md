# Class 11 Reading Notes

## Video and Audio Content

1. The first influx of online videos and audio were made possible by proprietary plugin-based technologies like Flash and Silverlight. Both of these had security and accessibility issues, and are now obsolete, in favor of native HTML solutions video and audio elements and the availability of JavaScript APIs for controlling them.

2. SRC element for videos wokrs similar to images, it just links to the videos source. The controls attribute is important to allow the user to control the video.

3. Fallback content is importnat because not all browsers support the same video files.

4. Audio and video are brothers. Video is a theater kid and loves to show you what's happening. Audio reads to people because he doesn't like getting up on stage but you can still listen to him.

## CSS Grid

1. Flex allows you to control things in one direction. While Grid allows you to control sections going in multiple directions.

2. Grid contatainer is the Grid as whole, Grid lines are with the Grid container and allows the creation of smaller containers. Grid item is the item placed with the container between the lines.

## Responsive Images

1. Another reason for responsive images other than web design is larger images can waste bandwidth for mobile users by downloading a large image intended for desktop users, when a small image would do for their device.

2. Srcset defines the set of images we will allow the browser to choose between, and what size each image is. Sizes defines a set of media conditions (e.g. screen widths) and indicates what image size would be best to choose, when certain media conditions are true

3. Srceset can be mroe helpful for responsive images than JS and CSS becasue it's an HTML element that will load first.
