4. you can change ordered lists in roman numerals or start them at higher numbers

## CSS The Box Model

1. In the story of The Box Model the margin would be a parent contaning their youngest child the padding 

2. The four parts of the box model are the Margin, Border, Padding, and content

## Arrays, Operators, Expressions, Conditional and Loops

1. In an Array you can store strings, numbers, objects, and even other arrays

2. The people array is valid. You can acces the values stored by logging their index number in brackets and if it's an array in an array you can cahin inex numbers

3. Four Shorthand Operators: += is shorthand for x = x + y, -= s shorthand for x = x - y, *= s shorthand for x = x * y, and /= s shorthand for x = x / y.

4. The question would evaluate to 10dog. Adding a string and number together will just push them together. It will have boolean expression of false but it will not show in the log unless specifically asking for it

5. You can use a conditional statement when you are asking yes or no quesions on a webpage

6. An example of a loop being useful is if you want a particular answer and want to keep asking a question until the answer is said
