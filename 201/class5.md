# Class 5 Reading Notes

## HTML Media

1. Alt is added to a website for screen readers to describe an image for people with visual impairments

2. You can improve accesibility in images by giving a really good alt text to it to convey what the image is showing

3. An example of when to use figures and figcaptions would be when you have a ton photos with different captions and you need to identify which captions go where

4. SVG is good for elements or icons while gif is good for simple images and animations

5. For screenshots you should use lossless WebP or PNG because if not text could become fuzzy

## Using Color in CSS

1. Foreground changes the text and any decoration, background changes the color behind it

2. To touch up a blog with color you could do many things like adding borders around sections and adding color to it or changing his heading colors or background colors. There is lots to change on an empty blog

3. You need to consider using web-safe fonts because not all systems have access to the same fonts as you

4. Font size changes the size of the letters. Font weight changes the boldness of the letters. Font style changes letters to italics or normal, etc

5. Two ways you could add spacing to your h1 element are word spcaing or letter spacing
