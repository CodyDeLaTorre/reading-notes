# Reading Notes Class 8

## CSS - Flexbox

1. You can control alignment in one axis, a row or a column, not both together as we can do in grid.

2. Your cross axis is alwasy opposite of you main axis and you can set the main axis either to column or row

3. A screen reader will read out the content in the logical order and reordering the visual display away from how things are ordered in the HTML document negatively impacts accessibility

## CSS Layout - Flexbox

1. With float Vertically centering a block of content inside its parent was difficult and making all the children of a container take up an equal amount of the available width/height, regardless of how much width/height is available is also difficult and flexbox solves some of these issues.

2. This topic connects with my long term goals because it helps me understand CSS a little better. Which helps me be a better developer
