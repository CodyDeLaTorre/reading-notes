# Class 12 Reading Notes

## JS Canvas

1. The Canvas element allows you to draw 2D graphics using JavaScript.

2. The importance of the closing tag in canvas is that any content in between it is fallback content in case the browser doesn't support the canvas.

3. The getContext() takes one argument which is the type of context. For example, you use the "2d" to get a 2D rendering context object, which is an instance of the CanvasRenderingContext2D interface. The 2D rendering context allows you to draw shapes, text, images, and other objects.

## Chart.JS

1. Chart.JS is code that creates a chart on webpages. It can be brought in through NPM, github or cdns.

2. 3 chart types you can make are bar, bubble, and line charts.

## Animated Charts

1. Charts are easier to look at and convey data quickly, but theyâ€™re not always easy to create.

2. Chart.JS can help me by allowing me to render my old tables as charts since they look a lot better.
