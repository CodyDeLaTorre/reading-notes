# Class 7 Reading Notes

## Domain Modeling

1. We need Domain Modeling because it helps us better understand problems and can helps us verify that we understand the problem

## HTML Table Basics

1. Layout tables reduce accessibility for visually impaired users and Tables are not automatically responsive

2. Some semantic elements in a table: (`<table></table , <td></td> , <tr></tr>`)

## Introdicing Constructors

1. A constructor is like a dynamic object/function hybrids that allows us to create and edit objects using parameters.

2. 'This' isn't that useful when typing object literals but theyre useful in construcors because it allows you to make your code dynamic

## Object Prototypes Using Constructors

1. Prototypes are like how we have SGTs in the Army and with every SGT there is soldiers, instead of making a new SGT for every fucntion we can use the soldeirs to do some of those functions
