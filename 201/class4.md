# Class 4 Reading Notes

## HTML Links

1. To create a link in html we wrap the text in an a tag.

2. The href attribute contains the actual link

3. We can ensure are accesible to all readers by adding by having good link text and keeping it short and possibly adding the title attribute

## CSS Layout

1. Normal flow is the way the webpage gets laid out by default

2. Block level elements fill all available in-line space of the parent element while in-line elements are just the size of their content

3. Static positioning is the default that every element gets

4. With Absolute positioning you can create popup information boxes, control menus, rollover panels, UI features that can be dragged and dropped anywhere on the page, and so on

5. absolute positioning fixes an element in place relative to its nearest positioned ancestor, fixed positioning usually fixes an element in place relative to the visible portion of the viewport

## JS Functions

1. Invoking is to run a function and declaring is to create a function

2. Parameters and arguments are the same thing

## Pair Programming

1. I think Job Environment Readiness of pair programming will benefit me becasue i have never been in a job that required programming

2. I also think I could benefit from the greater efficiency since mistakes are more easily caught in pair programming
