# Class 6 Reading Notes

## JS Object Basics

1. If someone who does not know JavaScript asked me to describe an object I would describe it as a box that you can store any values in and access whnever needed.

2. Objects are good for transfering a bunch of data that is related to eachother.

3. To me, objects are different from arrays beacuse you want to store a bunch of related data types that make up a single item, an array is data of multiple items sotred in one place

4. You want to use bracket notation when an object property name is held in a variable and you can't use dot notation to access the value

5. In the example provided this refers to the code that is currenlty being written in the object and the advantage of using this is that it enables you to use the same method definition for every object you create

## The DOM

1. The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page

2. JavaScript can access the DOM through keywords
