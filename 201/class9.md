# Reading Notes Class 9

## HTML Forms

1. Web Forms are important because they allow us to recieve data from users

2. It's important to remember that the bigger your form, the more you risk frustrating people and losing users. Keep it simple and stay focused and ask only for the data you absolutely need

3. 5 Form Elements: Label element is for single line input. The Input field for the email is a field that only accepts emails. The Textarea is a multiline text field. The Button element allows you to make reset, submit, or custom buttons with JavaScript. li's are also commonly used for structure purposes

## JavScript Events

1. JS Events are just reactions to what the user does

2. Inside the addEventListener() function, we specify two parameters: the name of the event we want to register this handler for, and the code that comprises the handler function we want to run in response to it.

3. The event object provides extra features and information .The target within even object is useful because it targets the element that the event occurs on

4. Event Bubbling is events that occur in an scending order from first element to its parents elements. Event Capturing goes in the opposite direction of bubbling, outside-in
