# Class 7 Reading Notes

## REST

1. Who is Roy Fielding? He helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet… and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does. His name is on the specification for the protocol that is used to get pages from servers to your browser.
2. Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world? They weren't designed to be used like that. When Fielding and his colleagues started building the web, being able to talk to any machine anywhere in the world was a primary concern. But most of the techniques developers later used to get computers to talk to each other didn't have those requirements. You just needed to talk to a small group of machines.
3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created? HTTP is a general purpose protocol for applying verbs to nouns.
4. What does a GET do? Get gets (haha) all of the stuff it can from the browser using http so it can display it on the browse
5. What does a POST do? Adds something to another system,
6. What does PUT do? Replaces something in another system
7. What does PATCH do? Partial update
