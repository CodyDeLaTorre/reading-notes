# Class 4 Reading Notes

## Forms in React

1. An input form element whose value is controlled by React in this way is called a “controlled component”

2. We should update the the state as soon as they enter them just in case they have to walk away so they don't lose where they were at

3. We use value=this.state.value and then onChange=handleChange which we make into a helper function to update the value with this.setState to target what the user is entering

## The Conditional Ternary Operator

1. We would use the ternary operator to write less code when making an if statement.

2. x===y ? console.log(true) : console.log(false)
