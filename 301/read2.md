# Class 2 Reading Notes

## React Lifecycle

1. The render comes before the componetDidMount according to the diagram

2. The mounting phase is the first phase in the the react lifecycle

3. Order: Constructor, Render, React Updates, componetDidMount, componetDidUpdate, ComponetWillUnmount

4. ComponentDidMount-This method is invoked immediately after a component is mounted. If you need to load anything using a network request or initialize the DOM, it should go here. This method is a good place to set up any subscriptions. If you do that, donâ€™t forget to unsubscribe in componentWillUnmount().

## React State vs Props

1. You can pass things into a function with props. Parameters you want to be taken in by a component

2. Props are passed into a component and state is handled inside the component

3. We render our application when we update our state

4. We could store user inputs with state
